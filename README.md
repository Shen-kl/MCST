## MCST: An adaptive tracking algorithm for high-speed and highly maneuverable targets based on bidirectional LSTM network

This is the Pytorch implementation of "MCST: An adaptive tracking algorithm for high-speed and highly maneuverable targets based on bidirectional LSTM network"

The proposed model consists of the Predictor and the Updater, and is used to track high speed and high maneuvering targets in three-dimensional space.
